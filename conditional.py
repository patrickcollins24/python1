    #Hey Hi python !!
    #Doews what the user typed(user_input) match the magic number(MAGIC_NUMBER)?
    #If it does, will you please tell the user: "whoa! Are you a mind reader?"
    #If it doesn't will you pleas tell the user: "Sorry, try again next time."
    #And then you can stop running the program
    #Thanks Python!!!
